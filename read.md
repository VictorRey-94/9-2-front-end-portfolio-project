## Made By Victor
- Created an App using HTML, JS, and CSS..
- Ferched all information using [The Dog API](https://www.thedogapi.com/).
- By creating a loop, adding an EventListener to fetch all the breeds of dogs available in the API, a gallery was created to showcase the name, and image of the breed.
