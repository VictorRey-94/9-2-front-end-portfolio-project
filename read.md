# Pawsitivy
- A site where all the information needed about dog breeds is found. 
- The goal of "Pawsitivity" is to educate users on dog breeds to make sure they know as much of a breed before going out to the adoption world, by doing this we ensure the best quality of life for both the dog and user.

## Made By Victor
- Created an App using HTML, JS, and CSS..
- All information was fetched using [The Dog API](https://www.thedogapi.com/).
- By creating a loop, adding an EventListener to fetch all the breeds of dogs available in the API, a gallery was created to showcase the name, and image of the breed.
- A search bar is provided for the user to specifically search for a desired breed of dog, which when inputed it will open the image of that specific dog.
- Below the gallery, a list of all dogs is also displayed so the user can click on the name rather than search and all the information pertaining to that dog will be shown in a new page.
- At the bottom of the page there is a footer with a link that will re-direct the user to a page containing the information of the web page creator.
